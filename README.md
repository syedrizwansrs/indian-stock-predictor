## 🗃️ Data Caching & Refresh Control

The application caches all fetched stock data in a persistent SQLite database (`data/stocks.db`).
By default, it loads recent data from the cache and only fetches new data if the cache is missing or outdated (older than 7 days).

### Forcing a Data Refresh (Bypassing the Cache)

You can force the application to fetch fresh data from the API and update the cache by using the `force_refresh` parameter in the `update_stock_data` method:

```python
from src.data_fetcher import DataFetcher
fetcher = DataFetcher()
symbol = "RELIANCE.BSE"
# Force a fresh fetch from the API, ignoring the cache
data = fetcher.update_stock_data(symbol, force_refresh=True)
```

### Manual Cache Management

- **Delete the database file**: To clear all cached data, simply delete `data/stocks.db` and it will be recreated on the next run.
- **Delete data for a specific symbol**: You can add a method to `DataFetcher` to remove data for a single stock (see below for a sample implementation).

### Example: Clear Cache for a Symbol

```python
def clear_symbol_cache(self, symbol: str):
    """Delete all cached data for a specific stock symbol."""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("DELETE FROM stocks WHERE symbol = ?", (symbol,))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

Add this method to your `DataFetcher` class if you want fine-grained cache control.

```

### Technical Limitations
- **Market Conditions**: Models trained on historical data may not perform well during unprecedented market conditions
- **Data Quality**: Predictions are only as good as the underlying data quality
- **Overfitting**: Models may overfit to historical patterns that don't persist
- **External Factors**: Cannot account for news, policy changes, or other external events

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   ```
   Solution: Get a free API key from Alpha Vantage and update .env file
   ```

2. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project directory and virtual environment is activated
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Database Issues**
   ```bash
   # Delete and recreate database
   rm data/stocks.db
   python -c "from src.data_fetcher import DataFetcher; DataFetcher()"
   ```

4. **Memory Issues with LSTM**
   ```python
   # Reduce sequence length or batch size in prediction_model.py
   sequence_length = 30  # instead of 60
   batch_size = 16      # instead of 32
   ```

5. **Rate Limiting**
   ```
   Solution: Increase API_CALL_DELAY in config.py or wait before making more requests
   ```
